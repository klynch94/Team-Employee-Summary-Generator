# Team Employee Summary Generator
As a manager who needs to create a team summary of his/her employees, this application makes it easy to create an organization chart with the appropriate details on each employee. 

The application is a Command Line Application that is run on the terminal. It utilizes the inquirier package to prompt the user for information. Depending on which employee the user wants to add to the team (manager, engineer or intern), it will ask for specific pieces of information about that role.

Below are some screenshots of how the application works and the finished output:

First it prompts the user to add an employee:

It will then prompt the user to add another team member or select no more employees if it has been completed:
